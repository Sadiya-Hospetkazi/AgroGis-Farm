12. Recommendation Engine

AI-like recommendations based on:
- Past action history
- Weather patterns
- Crop growth stages
- Seasonal factors

Examples:
- "Water early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize evaporation."
- "Regular weeding prevents pest infestations and disease spread."
- "Apply fertilizer during cooler parts of the day for best absorption."
- "Schedule irrigation based on soil moisture levels to avoid overwatering."
- "Check for pests and diseases regularly, especially during flowering."
- "Ensure proper spacing between seeds for healthy plant development."
