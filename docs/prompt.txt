AgroGig – Gigifying Everyday Farming Actions Into Measurable Rewards

Theme
"Gigifying Farming – Turning everyday farm actions into measurable signals & rewards."

1. Project Summary (Simple & Powerful)

AgroGig is a lightweight digital layer built on top of a farmer's natural workflow.
Farmers continue their daily activities — watering, weeding, monitoring, fertilizing —
and AgroGig automatically captures, validates, and rewards these micro-actions as "digital gigs."

The system uses simple inputs (voice/text) + light sensor data (optional)
to translate each action into:

a verified signal

a score

a micro-reward

a monthly progress report

Farmers don't need new habits — the system adapts to them.

5. Multilingual Setup (English, Hindi, Kannada)

Use:

Simple JSON translation files

Create translation objects:

English

{
  "log_action": "Log Action",
  "watering": "Watering the field",
  "weeding": "Weeding",
  "fertilizing": "Fertilizing"
}


Hindi

{
  "log_action": "क्रिया दर्ज करें",
  "watering": "सिंचाई",
  "weeding": "निराई",
  "fertilizing": "उर्वरक डालना"
}


Kannada

{
  "log_action": "ಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ದಾಖಲಿಸಿ",
  "watering": "ನೀರಾವರಿ",
  "weeding": "ಕಳೆ ತೆಗೆಯುವುದು",
  "fertilizing": "ರಸಗೊಬ್ಬರ ಹಾಕುವುದು"
}

6. Backend Logic (Simple Rule-Based AI)
Example: Weed Risk Score
If humidity > 70% AND temperature 20–30°C → Risk +50
If crop spacing is small → Risk +20
If irrigation happened in last 24h → Risk +10


Output:

{
  "risk": 78,
  "message": "High weed risk – early weeding advised."
}

Example: Watering Validation
If raining today → reduce score
If soil moisture < threshold → increase score
If crop stage = flowering → moderate score

7. Rewards Logic

For every correct gig:

+10 or +20 points

Unlock badges like:

"Smart Irrigator"

"Soil Protector"

"Weed Warrior"

In monthly report:

Discounts

Scheme eligibility

Fertilizer coupons (dummy)
